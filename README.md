# Shopping-cart
Shopping Website - the general idea is that the user is creating a shopping list, on sumbit, the server recieves the list and should respond back with the shop has in stock and ready for sale,
the product inventory would be stored locally via an object OR by using a seperate database
^ 
this is the next step in the project



Summary project i created to practice what i've learned in React & Node, currently the backend side needs more work done, the https requests are working on both sides
but the server side isn't doing any changes


This websites runs on Node.Js and React.JS using Vite
